# portfolio project

This is the first version of my portfolio website. 
It is not complete yet and I still have some issues to figure out.
I have spent a lot of time with the css and managed to nest myself into a deep hole of tangling unpredictable behaviour of mostly my image elements flooding outside divs, which I had a hard time understand why.

The hero image has a vertical scroll which I just cannot seem to get rid of despite hours of trial and error. One h2 heading on header section also has a vertical scrollbar :( 
Would appreciate some help :D
I am also not done with accessibility testing yet but I will keep updating this site.
